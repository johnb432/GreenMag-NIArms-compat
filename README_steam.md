[b]GreenMag - NIArms AiO (New) COMPAT[/b] bases itself off the mods GreenMag, GreenMag - RHS compat and also the work of CoseDola | Miller, also known as [W] Miller. Many thanks and credit to him for having made the base mod.

This mod contains some parts of the RHS compat, to make it compatible with RHS aswell if the RHS compat is loaded.

If you have my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2659418877]NIArms Weapon's balance[/url] loaded, it will also work with the extra magazines added.
